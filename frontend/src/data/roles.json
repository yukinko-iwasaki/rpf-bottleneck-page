                "text": "Vietnam: The Ministry of Finance (MOF) leads on fiscal transparency in Vietnam. In recent years, MOF has begun publishing comprehensive fiscal data: for example, it issues a Statistical Public Debt Bulletin every six months covering debt stock, debt service, and even projections, as required by the 2017 Public Debt Management Law. These debt bulletins (available on MOF’s website) greatly improve understanding of Vietnam’s debt position. The State Budget Law (2015) also mandates that the government present medium-term budget plans to the National Assembly and report on execution, enhancing clarity on fiscal policy. Vietnam’s transparency has room to grow, but it has come far – the World Bank’s 2013 Fiscal Transparency Review noted significant progress, like MOF’s publication of more budget reports and simpler presentation of budget data. Additionally, Vietnam participates in the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics, and General Statistics Office (GSO) releases fiscal indicators in its statistical yearbooks. Communication is also done via National Assembly sessions (televised) where the Finance Minister explains budget outcomes and plans to legislators and the public. While some areas (e.g. off-budget SOE debt) remain opaque (2023 Fiscal Transparency Report: Vietnam - Department of State), the sustained efforts in publishing budgets, debt data, and audit results are helping foster a shared understanding of Vietnam’s fiscal position.",
