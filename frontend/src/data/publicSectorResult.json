Such arrangements and policies include feasible tax policy decisions for revenue mobilization, diversification and smoothing mechanisms, prudent and well-informed medium-term fiscal and debt strategies, with an efficient prioritization and allocation of available resources in the medium-term, and controlled spending commitments and arrears.
